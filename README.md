## Exclusions

### `WordPress.Files.FileName.InvalidClassFileName`

According to the WordPress PHP Coding Standards:

> Class file names should be based on the class name with `class-` prepended and the underscores in the class name replaced with hyphens, for example `WP_Error` becomes:
>
> ```
> class-wp-error.php
> ```

_Source:_ https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions

This sniff will check on this naming convention:

```
Class file names should be based on the class name with "class-" prepended. Expected class-test.php, but found Test.php.
```

We often use the [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) autoloading mechanism and therefore deviate from it.

### `WordPress.Files.FileName.NotHyphenatedLowercase`

According to the WordPress PHP Coding Standards:

> Files should be named descriptively using lowercase letters. Hyphens should separate words.
>
> ```
> my-plugin-name.php
> ```

_Source:_ https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions

```
Filenames should be all lowercase with hyphens as word separators. Expected test.php, but found Test.php.
```

We often use the [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) autoloading mechanism and therefore deviate from it.

### `Universal.Arrays.DisallowShortArraySyntax`

According to the WordPress PHP Coding Standards:

> Using long array syntax ( `array( 1, 2, 3 )` ) for declaring arrays is generally more readable than short array syntax ( `[ 1, 2, 3 ]` ), particularly for those with vision difficulties. Additionally, itâ€™s much more descriptive for beginners.
> 
> Arrays must be declared using long array syntax.
